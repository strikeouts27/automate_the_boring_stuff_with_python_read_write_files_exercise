write mode: "w" 
Python allows you to write content to a file in a way similar to how the print() function “writes” strings to the screen. You can’t write to a file you’ve opened in read mode, though. 
Instead, you need to open it in “write plaintext” mode or “append plaintext” mode, or write mode and append mode for short.
Write mode will overwrite the existing file and start from scratch, just like when you overwrite a variable’s value with a new value. Pass 'w' as the second argument to open() to open the file in write mode.

.write() tells python to write stuff to the file for you. 

Where is the data I need? 
What are the needs of the project? 
I need a test file. 
Inside of the test file I need a test question for 50 states. 
Each question needs one correct answer. 
Each question requires three incorrect answers. 
These question orders need to be randomized. 

I need an answer key file. 
I would need each question presented. 
I would need an answer key for each question. 
Answer as a choice
